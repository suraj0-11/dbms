-- Queries
-- 1. Count the customers with grades above Bangalore’s average.

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT CUSTOMER_ID)
FROM CUSTOMER1
WHERE GRADE > (SELECT AVG(GRADE) FROM CUSTOMER1 WHERE CITY = 'BANGALORE');

-- 2. Find the name and numbers of all salesmen who had more than one customer.

SELECT S.SALESMAN_ID, S.NAME
FROM SALESMAN S
WHERE S.SALESMAN_ID IN (SELECT C.SALESMAN_ID FROM CUSTOMER1 C GROUP BY C.SALESMAN_ID HAVING COUNT(*) > 1);

-- 3. List all salesmen and indicate those who have and don’t have customers in their cities (Use UNION operation.)

SELECT SALESMAN_ID, NAME, CUST_NAME, COMMISSION
FROM SALESMAN S
LEFT JOIN CUSTOMER1 C ON S.CITY = C.CITY
UNION
SELECT SALESMAN_ID, NAME, 'NO CUSTOMER', COMMISSION
FROM SALESMAN
WHERE SALESMAN_ID NOT IN (SELECT SALESMAN_ID FROM CUSTOMER1 WHERE CUSTOMER1.CITY = SALESMAN.CITY);

-- 4. Create a view that finds the salesman who has the customer with the highest order of a day.

CREATE VIEW ELITSALESMAN AS
SELECT S.SALESMAN_ID, S.NAME, O.ORD_DATE, O.ORD_NO
FROM SALESMAN S
JOIN ORDERS O ON S.SALESMAN_ID = O.SALESMAN_ID
WHERE (O.ORD_DATE, O.PURCHASE_AMT) IN (SELECT ORD_DATE, MAX(PURCHASE_AMT) FROM ORDERS GROUP BY ORD_DATE);

-- 5. Demonstrate the DELETE operation by removing salesman with id 1000. All his orders must also be deleted.

DELETE FROM ORDERS WHERE SALESMAN_ID = 1000;
DELETE FROM SALESMAN WHERE SALESMAN_ID = 1000;
